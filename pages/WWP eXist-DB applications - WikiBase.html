		<div id="mw-content-text" lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr"><div class="mw-parser-output"><p>The Women Writers Project uses the eXist-DB database to query, transform, and publish XML files. Most of these “applications” are actually divided between eXist and the WWP server file system. In general, eXist is used to store and index XML files. The database also holds XQuery scripts which, on request, parse and return data in a web-friendly format (generally JSON or HTML).
</p><p>On the server file system, an application mainly consists of an index HTML file and a Javascript file, as well as other web assets (CSS, images, etc.). The Javascript file is a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://backbonejs.org">Backbone.js application</a> that makes calls out to the eXist application, using the responses to populate most pages in the browser. In fact, though the URL changes, a user navigating the WWP subproject site never actually leaves index.html. Instead, the Backbone app modifies the webpage and browser URL to match the conceptual “page” chosen by the user.

<h3 class="mw-headline" id="Women_Writers_in_Context">Women Writers in Context</h3>
<p>The code for the WWiC website can be found in Subversion at DEV/exhibits. (Unlike the other endeavors, WWiC has no separation of code from data.) On the server, the index page and assets are symlinked from the “exhibits” directory to WEB/context. As a result, WWiC is visible from both <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://wwp.northeastern.edu/context">https://wwp.northeastern.edu/context</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://wwp.northeastern.edu/research/projects/exhibits">https://wwp.northeastern.edu/research/projects/exhibits</a>.
</p><p>WWiC is not an EXPath application, but it does use XQueries as REST endpoints. In eXist, the XML, XSLT, and XQueries can be found at /db/exhibits.
</p><p>eXist users in the “exhibits” group should have write access to the collection on the WWP-Test server. This enables easy pre-publication proofing. Publication on the production server requires a database admin.
</p>
<h3 class="mw-headline" id="Women_Writers_in_Review">Women Writers in Review</h3>
<p>The code for the WWiR website can be found in Subversion at DEV/reception/utils. On the server, the index page and assets are symlinked from the “reception” directory to WEB/review. Unlike WWiC, Review is available only at <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://wwp.northeastern.edu/review/index.html">https://wwp.northeastern.edu/review/index.html</a>. The files are stored at <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://wwp.northeastern.edu/research/publications/reception/utils/index.html">https://wwp.northeastern.edu/research/publications/reception/utils/index.html</a>, but the Backbone.js script will not work if accessed there.
</p><p>WWiR is also an EXPath package, and uses RESTXQ to serve out data via an API. The XML files are stored in eXist at /db/reception-data, and the EXPath application will be installed at /db/apps/review. The base URI for the API is “<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.wwp.northeastern.edu/exist/restxq/reception">http://www.wwp.northeastern.edu/exist/restxq/reception</a> .” For more information on the API endpoints available, see <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.wwp.northeastern.edu/exist/restxq/reception/api-docs">https://www.wwp.northeastern.edu/exist/restxq/reception/api-docs</a>.
</p>
<h3 class="mw-headline" id="Featured_Quotation">Featured Quotation</h3>
<p>The Featured Quotation on the WWP home page is generated randomly, with a request to eXist from the Javascript file at WEB/utils/bin/javascript/wwp.js. The HTML response then populates the quote widget.
</p><p>The code in eXist is not an EXPath application. The XQuery qotr.xq and XSLT qotd.xslt are maintained in WEB/utils/stylesheets, and are saved in eXist at /db/quotes. Unlike most other eXist endeavors, the XML source is not stored in eXist. Instead, the XQuery uses the quotography on the appropriate server (production by default) at WEB/utils/xml/quotography.xml.
</p>
<h3 class="mw-headline" id="Text_Tracker">Text Tracker</h3>
<p>The Text Tracker is a small EXPath application that uses data from the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://trello.com/b/GO8FM0gG/text-tracking">Text Tracking Trello board</a> to create a table of forthcoming WWO texts. The code is maintained at DEV/text-tracker. When installed into eXist, the XQuery and XSLT will be stored at /db/apps/text-tracker, and the collection /db/trello-data will be created, if it doesn't already exist.
</p><p><b>Important:</b> Because the Text Tracker requires a Trello user's credentials, the file at /db/trello-data/trello.xml must be readable by <b>only</b> database administrators. It is not checked into Subversion. The XML structure of trello.xml looks like this:
</p>
<pre>&lt;credentials&gt;
  &lt;key&gt;&lt;/key&gt;
  &lt;oauthSecret&gt;&lt;/oauthSecret&gt;
  &lt;token as="USERNAME"&gt;&lt;/token&gt;
&lt;/credentials&gt;
</pre>
<p>When the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://wwp.northeastern.edu/wwo/texts/new/forthcoming.html">“forthcoming texts” web page</a> loads, Javascript sends an AJAX request to get the table from the EXPath application. The Javascript file can be found at WEB/utils/bin/javascript/forthcoming.js.
</p><p>See Trello's <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://developers.trello.com/v1.0/reference#introduction">documentation</a> for more on its API.
</p>
<h3 class="mw-headline" id="Internal_Documentation">Internal Documentation</h3>
<p>The code for Internal Documentation is located in Subversion at WEB/research/publications/documentation/internal.
</p><p>WWiC is not an EXPath application, but it does use XQueries as REST endpoints. In eXist, the XML, XSLT, and XQueries can be found at /db/wwpdoc.
</p><p>eXist users in the group “wwpdoc” should have write access to this collection on the WWP-Test server. This enables easy pre-publication proofing. Publication on the production server requires a database admin.
</p>
<h3 class="mw-headline" id="Inspectre">Inspectre</h3>
<p>Unlike the other eXist-endeavors, the Inspectre lives only in eXist. It is an EXPath application maintained at DEV/inspectre, and installed into eXist at /db/apps/inspectre. As part of the installation process, missing XML reports in /db/inspectre-data/current are added from DEV/inspectre/reports. However, once a report is present in the Inspectre data collection, it will not be replaced during installation. This keeps encoders’ edits from being overwritten.
</p><p>The Inspectre should be installed only on WWP-Test. eXist users within the “inspectre” group will be able to act on reports.
</p>
<h2 class="mw-headline" id="Maintaining_eXist-supported_endeavors">Maintaining eXist-supported endeavors</h2>
<h3 class="mw-headline" id="Updating_the_HTML_content_of_a_web_page">Updating the HTML content of a web page</h3>
<p>To update the content of any given page, you will need to determine if that content is generated, and, if it <em>is</em> generated, <em>where</em> it is generated. This varies from project to project.
</p><p>In general: representations of XML documents are generated with XSLT stored in eXist. You may need to update the XML encoding, the XSL transformation, or both. The HTML output is usually passed on to XQuery and Javascript without changes.
</p><p>The outer structure of a web page, such as the header or footer, is likely generated by Backbone.js. Whole pages of static content, such as “About” pages, can be maintained in HTML files, Backbone.js templates, or XQuery functions.
</p>
<h3 class="mw-headline" id="Updating_images.2C_CSS.2C_Javascript"><span id="Updating_images,_CSS,_Javascript"></span>Updating images, CSS, Javascript</h3>
<p>In general, web assets—including images, CSS stylesheets, and Javascript files—are maintained on the server file system, not in eXist. To add or update these files, commit your changes to Subversion. Then log into the WWP server using your Centrify credentials, and <kbd>cd</kbd> to the directory where those assets are housed. Issue an <kbd>svn up</kbd>, then check the website to make sure the changes went through. (Ideally you’ll have updated Test first, so that any bugs can be resolved without downtime on production.)
</p>
<h3 class="mw-headline" id="Updating_XML_data">Updating XML data</h3>
<p>If XML data is stored in eXist for transformation and publication, it can be updated by navigating to the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://wwp-test.northeastern.edu/exist/apps/eXide">eXide web editor</a>, logging in, and uploading the newest files to the correct data folder.
</p><p>Besides using a direct link, you can also navigate to eXide through the eXist Dashboard “Launcher”:
</p>
<div class="center"><div class="floatnone"><div class="MediaTransformError" style="width: 800px; height: 249px; display:inline-block;">Error creating thumbnail: File missing</div></div></div>
<p>The eXide editor looks like this. You’ll need to log in before adding or updating any files.
</p>
<div class="center"><div class="floatnone"><div class="MediaTransformError" style="width: 800px; height: 394px; display:inline-block;">Error creating thumbnail: File missing</div></div></div>
<p>eXide has a feature called “DB Manager”, which you can find under the “File” menu. Once you’ve logged in, you can use the DB Manager to upload and modify files within the eXist database.
Most directories can only be edited by users with certain permissions. If you find you don’t have the ability to work in a folder you think you should have access to, contact the person in charge of WWP’s eXist instances (currently Ash Clark).
</p>

<p>As an example, say you want to add a new Exhibit to Women Writers in Context. You would commit your changes as usual, then log into eXide. Once in the DB Manager, you would navigate to the directory you want. Fair warning: the DB Manager is set up so that clicking the contents of the “Name” field will start the process of changing the name of the file or directory. To navigate the database, double-click on one of the other table cells in the row you want.
</p><p>The Exhibits XML files are stored at /db/exhibits/xml. Once you’d navigated to the “exhibits” and then “xml” directories, you would start the upload. The button to do this is the one shaped like a cloud with an arrow, found at the top of the DB Manager widget.
</p>
<div class="center"><div class="floatnone"><div class="MediaTransformError" style="width: 800px; height: 381px; display:inline-block;">Error creating thumbnail: File missing</div></div></div>

<p>After you’ve changed something in eXist, you can visit the relevant WWP Test application in order to proof the file in its HTML form. You can continue to edit the file in Subversion and re-upload it to eXist as often as you like.
</p>
<h3 class="mw-headline" id="Updating_XQuery_or_XSLT">Updating XQuery or XSLT</h3>
<p>If the eXist part of an endeavor is <b>not</b> an EXPath package, updating its XQuery or XSLT is as easy as committing your changes, then uploading the changed file to eXist using the steps above.
</p><p>If the project <em>does</em> include an EXPath package, you will first need to rebuild the package. On the command line, navigate to the project-specific folder where the code is kept. In the directory containing a file called “build.xml”, use the command <kbd>ant</kbd>. Apache Ant should then create a XAR file (really a ZIP file).
</p><p>To install an EXPath package into eXist, log into the Dashboard. (You must have database administrator privileges!) Click on the icon for the “Package Manager” app.
</p>

<div class="center"><div class="floatnone"><div class="MediaTransformError" style="width: 600px; height: 328px; display:inline-block;">Error creating thumbnail: File missing</div></div></div>
<p>When opened, the Package Manager shows a list of the packages that are currently installed, with those able to be upgraded at the top. If you click the upload icon, <a href="/mediawik/index.php/File:EXist-2.2-dashboard-package-manager-upload-icon.png" class="image"><img alt="EXist-2.2-dashboard-package-manager-upload-icon.png" src="/mediawik/images/3/3b/EXist-2.2-dashboard-package-manager-upload-icon.png" decoding="async" width="49" height="39" data-file-width="49" data-file-height="39" /></a> a pop-up menu will appear, allowing you to install the XAR file you just created.
</p>
<div class="center"><div class="floatnone"><div class="MediaTransformError" style="width: 600px; height: 327px; display:inline-block;">Error creating thumbnail: File missing</div></div></div>
