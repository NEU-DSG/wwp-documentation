<p>This page needs more detail...
</p><p>The WWP license renewal process starts in March. More detailed documentation of the process is contained in the WWPDeliveryManagement database (click on "Renewals" at the opening screen).
</p><p>Essentially the process is as follows:
</p>
<ol><li>Update the wording of the renewal letter to include any new information about the collection, change due dates and discount information, etc.</li>
<li>Check on any last unpaid or unrenewed licenses from the prior license year</li>
<li>Archive the current information (best to save a copy of the database, but also go through the archiving process provided in the database itself)</li>
<li>Identify the institutions that need to renew (i.e. excluding multi-year licenses, etc.)</li>
<li>Update the start and end dates for the renewing institutions</li>
<li>Identify the consortially billed institutions and flag them separately; generate consortial renewal lists and send them to our consortial contacts (they will need to confirm FTEs and renewals, after which we can send them an invoice)</li>
<li>Identify the institutions receiving discounts, and generate their invoices and renewal letters</li>
<li>Identify the institutions not receiving discounts, and generate their invoices and renewal letters</li>
<li>Of the above, send email renewals (with attached PDF invoices) to those that wish to receive emailed renewals; print and mail renewals to those that prefer printed renewals.</li></ol>
<p>Renewal information will come back in several forms:
</p>
<ul><li>Checks (from these, we infer that the institution wishes to renew)</li>
<li>Faxed renewal forms (Jen will typically handle these unless they require special treatment)</li>
<li>Emailed renewal forms to WWP@brown.edu</li></ul>
<p>Cases that require an updated invoice:
</p>
<ul><li>Some institutions require an invoice dated July 1 (or some other date) to satisfy a purchasing requirement</li>
<li>Some institutions will request a three-year renewal (with 30% discount)</li>
<li>Some institutions will have experienced a change in FTE, resulting in a change in annual fee</li></ul>
