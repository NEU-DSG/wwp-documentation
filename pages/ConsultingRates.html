</p>
<h3 class="mw-headline" id="Workshops:">Workshops:</h3>
<ul><li>For a standard 3-day workshop requiring travel, $2000 for the WWP plus $1000 honorarium per instructor</li>
<li>For non-standard workshops (requiring special prep), $3000 for the WWP plus $1000 honorarium per instructor</li>
<li>For workshops not requiring travel, the instructor honorarium is waived.</li>
<li>For institutions that are not TEI  members, we charge an additional $500 which goes to the TEI for a one-year div3 institutional membership</li></ul>
<h3 class="mw-headline" id="Consulting:">Consulting:</h3>
<ul><li>We charge a daily rate of $800 to $1000 per day, per person, depending on the nature of the work. This represents an overhead charge on top of the fractional salary/benefits.</li></ul>
<h3 class="mw-headline" id="Rationale:">Rationale:</h3>
<ul><li>Instructors receive a fixed honorarium for workshops or consulting where travel is involved</li>
<li>We are in effect subsidizing workshops as a public service (since we charge less per day for workshops than for other kinds of consulting)</li>
<li>We charge a fairly high rate for consulting services because they take a disproportionate amount of attention (since they don't draw on or feed into other WWP activities); it isn't worth doing these projects unless they contribute substantially to the WWP's finances.</li></ul>
