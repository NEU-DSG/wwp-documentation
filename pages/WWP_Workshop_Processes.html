<h2 class="mw-headline" id="Initial_setup">Initial setup</h2>
<ul><li>Book Snell Library, Room 422 in Outlook</li>
<li>Add conference to WWP website:
<ul><li>XML eventography (utils/xml/events.xml)</li>
<li>Seminar page index (outreach/seminars/index.html)</li>
<li>Events page (about/events.html)</li></ul></li>
<li>Set up event folder with schedule page</li>
<li>Email Northeastern CashNet (cashnetops@northeastern.edu) to request setup for credit card payments
<ul><li>Typically, they will be able to re-use an earlier conference</li>
<li>Confirm: Conference dates, Conference title, rates, registration cap, email addresses where reports should be sent, information we want to capture from registrants, registration deadline (needs to be on a weekday), index to credit</li>
<li>For example: "This is under the category of WWP Workshops and the rates are: $450 regular registration; $300 students and TEI members; free for Northeastern community members. The registration cap should be 20 people. The reports should go to wwp[at]northeastern[dot]edu and j.flanders[at]northeastern[dot]edu. Refunds in full are available at any time and the registrations should be credited to xxxxxx. The title of the workshop is: Introduction to TEI Encoding and Schema Design and it will be held April 4–6, 2018 with a registration deadline of March 30. For this event, we want to capture the same information we have in the past: Name, Address, Email, Organization, Role, and Field of Study."</li></ul></li>
<li>As soon as the registration link and schedule are live, circulate online:
<ul><li>TEI List</li>
<li>WWP List</li>
<li>SHARP</li>
<li>Humanist</li>
<li>DHSI</li>
<li>WWP Twitter</li>
<li>WWP announcement page</li></ul></li>
<li>As people register, send logistical email one (see example below).</li>
<li>Track all registrants' names and details and share these with Syd after the registration period has closed so that he can circulate the Oxygen details.</li>
<li>Two or three weeks before the event, meet to confirm who will be handling each section of the workshop.</li></ul>
<h2 class="mw-headline" id="Event_Preparation">Event Preparation</h2>
<p>Most of the below should happen as soon as possible after registration closes, which should be at least a week before the workshop; guest wifi accounts require a week's notice; there is more flexibility with the catering and library access requests. 
</p>
<ul><li>After registration closes, send logistical email two (see example below).</li>
<li>At least a week before the workshop, request NU-wave Guest credentials for all off-campus registrants (see: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://its.northeastern.edu/services/networks/nuwave-guest/#planners">https://its.northeastern.edu/services/networks/nuwave-guest/#planners</a>).</li>
<li>Order catering from Rebecca's Cafe (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.rebeccascafe.com/neu/rebeccas-neu-catering-menu.pdf">http://www.rebeccascafe.com/neu/rebeccas-neu-catering-menu.pdf</a>).</li>
<li>Request signs and name badges from library publicity staff (Jennie Robbiano, as of Spring 2018).</li>
<li>Get survey set up (see training materials for instructions and credentials)</li>
<li>Request library access for non-Northeastern guests (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdOGHgWGcSggCbMfM6whMjK4cZe8lcR0cRF_ZHXeoVGy3Ek3A/viewform">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdOGHgWGcSggCbMfM6whMjK4cZe8lcR0cRF_ZHXeoVGy3Ek3A/viewform</a>)</li></ul>
<h2 class="mw-headline" id="After_the_workshop">After the workshop</h2>
<ul><li>Send follow-up email with survey</li>
<li>Update all website pages to move the workshop from upcoming to past events
<ul><li>The eventography will update automatically</li>
<li>You need to manually update the seminars index and events page</li>
<li>You also need to add the event to the past events list</li></ul></li></ul>
