<p>There are 2 ways to sign up for a Trello account
</p><p>Trello is a digital tool for organizing and tracking progress on collaborative projects. For more information about Trello, see their list of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://help.trello.com/customer/portal/topics/401143-getting-started/articles">helpful guides</a> or <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://trello.com/tour">take a tour</a> of the site. 
</p>
<ol><li>Sign up with Google Account:</li></ol>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><ul><li>Visit <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.trello.com">Trello.com</a> and click on "login" in the top right corner</li>
<li>Select button to log in with "Google Account" and follow the instructions.</li></ul></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ol><li>You may also create an entirely new account:</li></ol>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><ul><li>Visit <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.trello.com">Trello.com</a> and click on "sign up" in the top right corner</li>
<li>Follow the instructions to create a new account</li></ul></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>After you have registered, please email the Project Manager (currently Alicia, a.peaker@neu.edu). This enables the project manager to add you to the WWP organization on Trello and assign texts to you. 
</p><p>Once the Project Manager has added you to the WWP organization, you will have access to the "Text Tracking" board.
</p>
<h2 class="mw-headline" id="The_Text_Tracking_Board">The Text Tracking Board</h2>
<p>Trello uses "boards" to organize projects. Each board is divided into lists that represent the stages of the project. The WWP's Text Tracking Board divides the text encoding process into 9 major stages or lists, detailed below:
</p>
<ol><li>Unencoded Texts: These are texts that are ready to be encoded.</li>
<li>Capture: During this phase, encoders begin the process of digitally transcribing the text.</li>
<li>1st Proof: Once the encoder has completed the capture and transcription of the text, the text is printed out and proofread by another encoder</li>
<li>1st Correx: During this phase, a third encoder enters the corrections into Oxygen.</li>
<li>2nd Proof: During this phase, the text goes through a second proofreading by a new encoder.</li>
<li>2nd Correx: During this phase, corrections from the second proofreading are entered into the text.</li>
<li>Final Review: During this stage, WWP staff will review the text and consult with the initial encoder.</li>
<li>Ready for Publish: At this point, the text is ready to be published on Women Writers Online.</li>
<li>Published: Congrats! The text has been published.</li></ol>
<p>Each Trello list contains multiple "cards," and each card contains information about the unencoded text including file name, text author, text title, notes, and more.
</p>
<h2 class="mw-headline" id="How_to_Track_your_Text:">How to Track your Text:</h2>
<p>As you complete each stage of the text tracking process, move the card by simply clicking and dragging it to the next stage of the process. Trello will automatically record the date of the move in the card's history.
</p><p>You can "subscribe" to individual Trello cards by clicking on the card, and then clicking on the "subscribe" button on the right side of the card. When you subscribe to a card, you get notifications in Trello when <u>anything</u> happens to the card. Follow the same steps to unsubscribe from a card. 
</p><p>You can control how and when you receive Trello notifications by changing your settings. For more information, check out Trello's guide to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://help.trello.com/customer/portal/articles/935534-receiving-trello-notifications">notifications</a>.
</p>
<h2 class="mw-headline" id="Adding_Notes_to_the_Card:">Adding Notes to the Card:</h2>
<p>It's a good idea to keep good notes on your Trello card like you do in the changelog of your text. It often take many months or even years for a text to move from initial capture to publication, and keeping good notes will ensure a smooth transition for future encoders and editors. 
</p><p>Kinds of information to add to the card:
</p>
<ul><li>Missing or illegible pages (ex. pages 206-209 missing; page 210 illegible)</li>
<li>Taking over a text/card in the middle of the stage (ex. jdoe.tjx took over capture on 5/05/11)</li>
<li>Needs proofing printout</li>
<li>Notes for proofers (ex. 2nd proof should take care for consistency in encoding of lists of titles)</li></ul>

<h2 class="mw-headline" id="FAQ">FAQ</h2>
<p><b>How can I find out which Trello cards have been assigned to me?</b>
</p><p>In the upper right hand corner, click on your full name. A drop-down menu will appear. Select "Cards" from that menu to view cards that have been assigned to you. 
</p><p><br />
<b>What do the colors on the cards mean?</b> 
</p><p>The green color indicates that the text is in the hands of an encoder who can continue to move it along the board as appropriate. The red color indicates that WWP staff (Julia, Syd, or the Project Manager) need to take review the text or resolve an issue before the card can be moved back to green and put back in the hands of the encoder.
